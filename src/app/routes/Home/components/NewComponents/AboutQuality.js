				<h1>It’s all about Quality</h1>
				<p>Did you know the chicken you buy at your local halal shop is on average 7 days old? It had been dunked in chlorine bath, and left immersed in chilled water to cool it. As a result, what you buy is about 20% water – not chicken!</p>
				<p>Our animals are ethically raised, and never caged. We air chill our meat, and flash freeze it to lock in the nutrition, texture, and flavor your would expect from your premium meat. We then vacuum pack these in perfect proportions for your meals!</p>
